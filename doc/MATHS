How to calculate the volume of a tank?
======================================

Most house tanks have a rectangular shape rounded on one axis, they can
lay flag (horizontal) or stand (on one of the rounded sides, vertical).

If you decompose the shapes, you can see that the rounded sides are actually
half-cylinders of the same size, removing these two half-cylinders we have
only a standard cuboid left, which means the volumne of the tank is the sum of
the volume of this cuboid plus the volume of the cylinder (two halfs).

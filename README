 curfuel
=========

curfuel is:
 - an avr driver/program to collect data from a resistive fuel sending unit
 - a python daemon reading the data from the serial/usb port

Driver
======
The driver is written in C and will cross-compile with GCC. It will make
the Atmel microcontroller wait for instructions from the serial/usb port
and sample the fuel level ten times over 100ms to create an average and
return it on the serial/usb port.

Daemon
======
This small piece of software will poll the micro-controller, reading the
serial/usb port and look for the raw_fuel_level output token then store the
interpreted gallon level in a flat text file. To save some space, only the
different readings are stored. The format is::

	utc_unix_timestamp:uc_ticks:raw_reading:gallons

``uc_ticks`` and ``raw_readings`` are kept as reference in case of anomaly,
they are respectively the internal millesecond tick of the microcontroller and
the raw reading on a 10bit scale averaged.
